# Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project is a basic host-based intrusion detection system created using shell scripting on Linux.  
It monitors the system for simple suspicious activities and logs alerts when something unusual is detected.

This project is developed as a college-level mini project to understand the basics of intrusion detection and Linux system monitoring.
